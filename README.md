Script file is needed to compile different zones of the map as well as add functionality such as buyables.

## To install 
Open mod tools and create a new zombie map called zm_streets

Once files are generated copy the three folders 'map_source', 'share', and 'usermaps' to your root directory for Call of Duty Black Ops 3. This is located where your steam downloads are pointed too.
