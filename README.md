## Note map is a work in progress 
This map has had many years coming starting my freshman year of college where my harddrive got corrupted in 2017 along with my map files.

Recovered what I could. Although all models were missing I decided to bring the map back. In 2020-2021 with all the extra time and a new PC, I booted up the map and copied what textures were left, then I remade it from memory. By the end of 2020 I had the map back up to where I lost it from corruption. I am now slowly but surely making progress to finish the map I had in mind.

Great reminder to use Git and always back up your files, so here we are.
